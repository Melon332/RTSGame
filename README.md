# RTSGame

This is suppose to be an RTS very similar to Command And Conquer: Generals

To run it:

- Download Unity Hub
- Get Unity version 2021.1.9 (Link for older versions: https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive)
- Run Unity and select the project folder.

I have been working on the project for about a week now and I have achieved:

- Unit Selecting

- Unit Moving(Still tweaking, not sure which AI pattern to follow)

- Multiple Unit Selecting

- Units Attacking

- Units Getting Destroyed

- Units Moving Close To Target Before Attacking

- If a Object moves from Unit Shooting Range, it will move into range and attack it.

- Destructable Objects(can be anything)

- Dynamic Camera Pan Limits.

- Camera Pan Speed (will be player controlled in the future)

- Dynamic Camera Scroll (will be player controlled in the future)

- Custom Cursor Depending On Action(not yet finished, still missing some actions)

- Build Buildings(Almost finished)

- Workers now move to the buildings and finishes them.

- Workers will now have their own "job", they won't interfere with other buildings aslong as they have a job.

- Object pool implemented.

- Enemy AI has been started on.

- The AI can build their own units and the units that they produce will walk around randomly, attack the player and also get aggro'ed incase they get attacked.

- This is fan project dedicated to the C&C Franchise aswell as developing my skills as a game developer further.

Things I want to implement further than the basic RTS gameplay:

- Saving And Loading

- User Creation

- Multiplayer(VERY UNLIKELY, would require a full rewrite of the player system but I will try)

- Better AI

- Animations to all the different units

- A campaign

- Different Factions

That's the project expectations that I have.
